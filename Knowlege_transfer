Ideas: Interactive Lecture

Case studdies: Bring up cases and ask the audience to asses how to agile it.
Have some cases where there is no agile.

Davids crazy transfer:

Step 1: Seminar with several cases where the groups are asked to apply the agile methodology to.
Step 2: homework, look at some agile videos to learn about agile
Step 3: Seminar where we explain how non of the cases actually are a good fit for agile.

Point: hammer home that agile is not great in many cases.

Agile lecture, do a lecture with several iterations.

Fliped classsroom lecture with "Agile" sticked on top of it. 
Then as the finnal punchline we bring up that Agile is very vauge and not that useful.
