## Knowlage transfer event

What to do for knowledge transfer event?

On seminar we have been thinking of using socrative page, which is a site where we can have multiple choice questions and let the audience answer with their phones. We can then go through each question and have a discussion about all the answers. This is interactive way of knowledge transfer.

Another iteractive knowledge transer is to have like a case which the audience can apply the different methods and try to solve the case.
